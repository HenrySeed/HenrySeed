### 👋  &nbsp;&nbsp; Hi I'm Henry, a full-stack developer from New Zealand &nbsp;🥝

**Fav tools:** ReactJS, Typescript, Python, 

**Currently Learning:** Next.js, Electron, Vue.js

During the week I'm an algorithm engineer at [Amy.app](http://amy.app). I specialise in using Expression Trees and tree based algorithms to build parts of our smart maths-tutoring system.

Outside of work, I love making my life easier with well-designed, JS driven tools. Mostly built in ReactJS, these are either for fun, or self-teaching purposes. Enjoy! &nbsp;🎉
