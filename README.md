### 👋  Hi I'm Henry Seed, a full-stack developer from New Zealand.

During the week I'm an algorithm engineer at [Amy.app](http://amy.app). I specialise in using Expression Trees and tree based algorithms to build parts of our smart maths-tutoring system.

Outside of work, I love making my life easier with well-designed, JS driven tools. Mostly built in ReactJS, these are either for fun, or self-teaching purposes. Enjoy!
